<h2><center>About Vendors</center></h2>
<p>Information Technology Vendor Management is a sub-component of the Information Technology (IT) Resource Management dealing with the intelligent sourcing of IT goods (procurement) and services (contracting/consulting). Vendor management requires familiarity with business needs and transforming those needs to goods and services from qualified and accredited suppliers. It also involves the implementation of technologies, processes, policies and procedures that support the effective running of the sourcing process and function. In investing in vendor management, organisations would look for the best way to get value out of the investment. This is in addition to protecting the valuable corporate and customer data, reducing or eliminating disruptions in customer service and internal operations, as well as reacting quickly and effectively to issues that might arise in the process. These issues cannot be properly addressed without a properly maintained historical record of vendor services and critical events.
